# DSP_STM32_RTOS
This Repo will follow me trying to get a mix up between Real Time techniques and some DSP on the STM32H745ZI ..

## CMSIS_DSP : 

CMSIS are offering a set of DSP funcitons that makes easier implementing DSP algorithms using C language on MCUs,
For instance I will be using them on my H745 running on the CM7 Arm Cortex.
Refer to  [Integrate DSP on CubeIDE](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus/configuring-dsp-libraries-on-stm32cubeide/ta-p/49637)

## Real Fast Fourier Transform :

RFFTs are widely used in modern DSPs application they are a variant of the well known Fast fourier transform and aims as well to get a signal from time domain to frequency domain.

Using provided Function will take us into an output buffer having both real and imaginary parts.
Every Frequency "Bin" is represented by an amplitude and phase which are the complex number generated by our function.
We should then extract the magnitude of every frequency bin.

First Results are shown below , for a static Sine Wave that i ganerated with C Code ONE Frequenc **Bin** is Shown is CubeMonitor.

As A first Application that combines FreeRTOS and DSP I will implement this :
