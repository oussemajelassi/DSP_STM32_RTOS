# DSP_STM32_RTOS
This Repo will follow me trying to get a mix up between Real Time techniques and some DSP on the STM32H745ZI ..

## CMSIS_DSP : 

CMSIS are offering a set of DSP funcitons that makes easier implementing DSP algorithms using C language on MCUs,
For instance I will be using them on my H745 running on the CM7 Arm Cortex.
Refer to  [Integrate DSP on CubeIDE](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus/configuring-dsp-libraries-on-stm32cubeide/ta-p/49637)

## Real Fast Fourier Transform :

RFFTs are widely used in modern DSPs application they are a variant of the well known Fast fourier transform and aims as well to get a signal from time domain to frequency domain.
