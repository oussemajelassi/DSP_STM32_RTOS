# DSP_STM32_RTOS
This Repo will follow me trying to get a mix up between Real Time techniques and some DSP on the STM32H745ZI ..

## CMSIS_DSP : 

CMSIS are offering a set of DSP funcitons that makes easier implementing DSP algorithms using C language on MCUs,
For instance I will be using them on my H745 running on the CM7 Arm Cortex.
